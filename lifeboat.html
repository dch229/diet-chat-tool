	<u><b>The Lifeboat Scenario</b></u>
	<p class="mainPar" id="lifeboatIntro">
	Nine people are taking a yacht. Suddenly, the yacht develops an unexpected leak and is sinking fast. There is only one lifeboat and it will accommodate only five people â€” not one more can fit and there are no more life boats or life jackets. People who cannot get on the lifeboat will lose their lives. There is no other way for you to save them.
	</p>

	<u><b>Your Mission</b></u>
	<p class="mainPar"id="missionStatement">
	Based on the given scenario, you and your partner must come to an agreement as to a rank of all these nine people in order of importance. The person who is evaluated as the most important one will be ranked as 1st, and the one who is evaluated as most unimportant one will be ranked as 9th. This rank will be used to decide which 5 people will get on the lifeboat. For example: if anyone gave up his/her chance to get on the boat, the next person on the list will take his/her position; or, if people on the lifeboat run out of food and water, the less important people will have to be dumped overboard. Your performance on this task will be evaluated from two aspects: <br /><br />1) On the team level, whether you and your partner reach an agreement in the end <br /><br />2) On the individual level, whether the final agreement is closer to your original thoughts or your partner's original thoughts.
