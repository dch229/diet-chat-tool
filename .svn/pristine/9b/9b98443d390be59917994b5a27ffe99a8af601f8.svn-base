        <h1><B>The Toolkit:</B></h1>
        <p>The toolkit is a text-based experimental resource for carrying out experiments on dialogue. The chat tool provides a way of intercepting participants' typed turns and selectively interfering with both their content and timing. This allows very fine-grained experimental control over what participants perceive the other participants as having typed.</p>
        <p>The chat tool includes a constantly expanding library of experiments that can be reconfigured. It also provides an extensive API for programming experimental interventions that are sensitive to the conversational context of the participants. Watch this <A HREF = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_ZmjBoEOLQ">video</A> to see a demonstration of how the chat tool works.  There is also a list of references below, which describes some of the experimental setups that use the chat tool methodology. For a deeper discussion, please read this<A HREF = "http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gmills/MillsHealey2013Submission.pdf"> paper.</A></p>

    <figcaption><p>Flowchart showing an experiment that introduces artificial clarification requests into the dialogue: The server generates a clarification request "home?" that appears to participant A to originate from participant B. Note that participant B is not aware of participant A's sub-dialogue.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</B>



    
        <h2><B>About the methodology</B></h2>
        <p>Our understanding of dialogue is much less advanced than our understanding of linguistic processing in monologue. One of the main reasons for this is practical - dialogue is inherently interactive and contextualised, which makes controlled experiments extremely difficult. Current techniques involve relatively coarse interventions such as manipulating task difficulty, manipulating objects in the task (e.g. occluding or replacing objects) or restricting participants' ability to interact (e.g. assigning participants to an overhearer role). Other designs use confederates who make scripted contributions</p> 
        <p>These techniques lack the kind of fine-grained experimental control found in studies of intra-individual language processing. This has held back progress in the analysis of dialogue. DiET is a new text-chat based experimental platform that addresses these problems. </p>
        <p>The basic strategy used by the chat tool involves participants communicating using a synchronous text chat tool. Instead of passing turns directly to the appropriate chat clients, each turn is routed via a server. This is configured to detect, for example, target words, phrases or syntactic constructions. This information can then be used to trigger specific experimental interventions. For example, the Figure above shows a `spoof' clarification request being inserted into the dialogue that appears to originate from another participant. The `spoof' sub-dialogue is not seen by the other participant and we have shown this can be done without disruption to the dialogue or detection by the participants.</p>




<h2><B>Possible kinds of experimental intervention include</B></h2>


        <ul><h3>Conceptual coordination:</h3>
          <li>Substitution of non-words, synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms</li>
          <li>Manipulation of the specificity of referring expressions</li>
          <li>Manipulation of  levels of alignment between interlocutors</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><h3>Procedural coordination:</h3>
          <li>Manipulation of sequencing and timing of participants' contributions</li>
          <li>Manipulation of turn-taking behaviour</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><h3>Group-membership and identity:</h3>
          <li>Manipulation of participatory status (e.g. overhearer)</li>
          <li>Manipulation of (apparent) identitiy of participant</li>
          <li>Assigning participants to different sub-groups, e.g. to allow group-specific conventions to emerge</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><h3>Linguistic structure:</h3>
          <li>Manipulation of lexical, syntactic and semantic constituents</li>
        </ul>


<h2><B>Recorded data</B></h2>

<p>The chat tool automatically records all the turns and keypresses, frequencies of use, recency, typing speed, 
number of edits (deletes, inserts, turn-formulation time, typing speed and typing overlap. This data is recorded in real-time, and can be used to generate 
experimental interventions that are sensitive to the immediate conversational context.</p>


<h2><B>Integration with Excel / SPSS / R / Matlab / OpenOffice </B></h2>

<p>All the data from the experiments is saved to a CSV (comma separated values) file.</p>

<p><A HREF = "turns.xlsx">This is what the data format looks like</A></p>


<h2><B>Naturalistic interventions</B></h2>

<p>The chat tool allows "spoofing" of interlocutors' typing speeds, allows mistypings that are sensitive to the keyboard layout, 
and using "txt" conventions.</p>

<p>The chat tool also includes a variety of interfaces, including an interface similar to ICQ / Facebook / Skype chat, and
another interface similar to UNIX talk which displays each character as it is typed.</p>


<h2><B>Some immediate questions about the methodology</B></h2>


<p><i>"But don't the participants notice that something very strange is going on and realize that the
 server is manipulating the text?"</i></P>

<p>Surprisingly, no! Participants tolerate very high levels of disturbance. Even quite unnatural-looking
 clarification requests are treated as bona fide attempts to sustain mutual-intelligibility. We have 
carried out over 2500 interventions, and so far only one participant suspected that a turn might have
 been generated artificially. Of course, the interventions do need to be piloted and designed judiciously.</p>

<br><br>
<p><i>"But this isn't the same as real spoken dialogue"</i></P>

<p>Yes and no. Text-based dialogue is similar to spoken dialogue in many important respects: text-based dialogue 
exhibits disfluencies, hesitations, interruptions, pauses, fillers, repair, acknowledgments.We have shown that
 text-based variants of key dialogue tasks, including the tangram task (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), maze 
task (Garrod and Doherty, 1994) and story-telling task (Bavelas et al., 1992), exhibit local and global patterns
 in participants' dialogue that are comparable to those observed in the original spoken versions of the task, 
and are amenable to experimental manipulation using the techniques outlined above (Healey, Purver, et al. 2003;
 Healey and Mills, 2006; Mills and Healey, 1997; Eshghi, 2009; Howes, Purver et al, 2011; Mills, 2011) </p>


<h2><B>Downloading and running the software</B></h2>

<p>The chat tool is programmed entirely in Java, and runs on all (Linux, Windows, Mac) platforms. It is released  under a GPL license.</p>


<p>There are two different ways of downloading and running the chat tool. Depending on what you want to do, you might not need to download all the additional libraries and computational linguistics resources. If any of the following are true, you can use the easy setup option:<ul>
          <li>You are using the chat tool for the first time.</li>
          <li>You want to run the chat tool to record conversations, without performing any interventions.</li>
          <li>You don't need to program any interventions.</li>
          <li>Your experimental script doesn't use the Stanford Parser, Part of Speech Tagger, or use Wordnet.</li>
         <li>Your experimental script doesn't load files on the server and send them to the clients, e.g. the maze game or the tangram task (Future versions of the chat tool will allow this).</li>
        </ul>

Otherwise, you will have to download the full version.<br><br><br>








<h2><b>Downloading and running the program without loading the libraries (Easy setup).</b></h2>
<p>These instructions assume that you will be running a setup with two participants. This requires three computers: 1 server and 2 clients.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ensure you have the correct version of java installed on each computer. The version of Java has to be at least version 7 or above. You can download and install the latest version of java from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html">here.</A></p></li>

<li><p>Connect all 3 computers to the network. Make sure that the firewall (on the server) is configured to allow incoming connections on port 20000. You can ensure this by disabling the firewall. If you are using institutional computers you might need to ask IT support to help with this step.</p></li>

<li><p>The chattool program is contained in a single file called <a href="http://svn.code.sf.net/p/dietsourcecode/code/chattool.jar">chattool.jar</A>. This file contains all the code needed to run the server and the clients. Download this file into a separate folder on each computer.
</p></li>

<li><p>On the server, double-click the file "chattool.jar". This should bring up a window that asks you whether you want to start the server or start the client. Select the option "start the server". 



<li><p>This should bring up another window that looks like the one below:
</p>
<img src='servergraphics2.jpg' width = "600" alt='missing' style=" box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 1px #404040;border-radius: 3px"> </img></li>


<li><p>You need to start the script that will simply relay messages between the clients. The name of this script is CCMESSENGERNORMAL. To start this script, scroll through the list (see the red rectangle in the Figure above which says "Right click on the correct name") until you see CCMESSENGERNORMAL.  Using the mouse, right-click on this name and select "Run as new experiment". This will start the script, and the server will then wait for connections from the clients.</p></li>



<li><p>
To connect the clients to the server, you need to know the Internet address of the server. The internet address is displayed in the Output window (see figure above where it says "Internet address of server"). In this figure it shows the internet address as 192.168.1.206. On your system it will be a different number. If there is a single internet address, make a note of this address.<br>
If there are two (or more) Internet addresses displayed on separate lines, you will have to use trial and error and try all of them to see which one works. If there is no number displayed, you will have to use the operating system to get the internet address (on a windows machine use IPCONFIG, on a Mac use IFCONFIG).</p>

<li><p>On each client computer, double-click on the file "chattool.jar". This should load a menu screen: </p><img src='serverorclient.jpg' width = "600" alt='missing' style=" box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 1px #404040;border-radius: 3px"> </img></li>

<li><p>This screen requires you to tell the client what the server's internet address is. In the red rectangle, replace the text 'localhost" with the internet address of the server. Select "START THE CHAT CLIENT". If the client connects with the server, the screen should disappear, and it should ask you for a ParticipantID. Type in any random sequence of 6 characters and press "OK". The client should then ask you for a username. Choose a username and press OK.<br>
</p></li>

<li><p>Repeat steps 8 - 9 for each client you would like to connect.</p></li>



<li><p>To watch the dialogue on the server, press the tab (see figure below)</p><img src='duringexperiment.jpg' width = "600" alt='missing' style=" box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 1px #404040;border-radius: 3px"></p></img></li>



<li><p>In order to make it so that the window always scrolls down to the last turn, select "View" and then "Toggle scrolling" (see below)</p><img src='togglescrolling.jpg' width = "600" alt='missing' style=" box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 1px #404040;border-radius: 3px"> </img></li>



</ol>

<h2><B>Downloading the source code and the libraries</B></h2>

<p>If you want to program the chat tool, or if you want to use an experimental setup that relies on the Stanford Parser, Part of Speech Tagger, or Wordnet you will have to download all the sourcecode and libraries. The chat tool is stored in a repository
 on sourceforge.net. To download and install it, do the following:</p>


<ol>
          <li><p>Ensure you have <A HREF = "http://netbeans.org">netbeans</A> installed (version 7.0 or higher). Note, this isn't strictly necessary, you can of course use your own IDE, such as Eclipse. Or, if you want, you can also run the program from the command-line. However, it is easiest to run it from netbeans: when loaded from netbeans there is no need to play around with linking libraries and directory paths etc. The chat tool program should run "out of the box".</P></li>

          <li><p>Ensure you have the latest version of java installed. Installing netbeans should also install the correct version of java</P></li>

          <li><P>Ensure you have an SVN client, such as <A HREF = "http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN (on windows machines)</A>. If you have Mac OSX, follow <A HREF="http://blog.grapii.com/2012/08/svn-missing-in-mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion/"> these</A> instructions.</P></li>


          <li><P>Download the full source code of the project by doing an SVN checkout from the repository which is located at: <B>https://svn.code.sf.net/p/dietsourcecode/code/ </B>  On a linux machine you would type something like the following at the command prompt:</P>
              <B><P><code><FONT SIZE="4">svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/dietsourcecode/code/</FONT></code></B></P>
              (You might be prompted to install certificates - see this <A HREF = "https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/svn/">documentation.</A>)

<h2><B>About / History</B></h2>

<p>This is the 4th incarnation of the chat tool. It grew out of the ROSSINI project P.G.T. Healey, Queen Mary University), was used by Matt Purver for his thesis, was rebuilt for G. Mills's thesis, and then programmed as a stand-alone experimental resource as part of the DiET project (EPSRC). It has been modified and extended as part of the DynDial project
 (Kings College and Queen Mary University) and also as part of ERIS (FP7 EU Project, G.J Mills, Stanford and University of Edinburgh).</p>

<p>Contributors to the design, coding and documentation of the chat tool include Pat Healey, Jonathan Ginzburg,
James King, Matt Purver, Arash Eshghi, Chris Howes and Eleni Gregoromichelaki.</p>
